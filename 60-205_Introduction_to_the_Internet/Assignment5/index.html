This website has been designed to fulfill the requirements of Assignment 5 for 60-205 (Introduction to the Internet). I made quite a few websites when I was younger, so I spent most of this course getting familiar with the newer standards and CSS as I have never used them before.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:center; padding: 10px">I was born and raised in Kingston, Ontario. After high school, I was unsure about what to do. I worked in a bakery for a couple years before deciding to get an advanced diploma in business at Humber College. I finished the program, but was unable to find meaningful work, or work above minimum wage. So I decided to go back to school and get more concrete, marketable skills in Computer Science.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:right; padding: 10px">I started my first year in Computer Science in September, 2015. I will be completing it in 2017, with the help of transfer credits from Humber. I feel like this program is much more up my alley than the Business program. I have always been drawn to computers, and I feel much more comfortable here. I'm looking forward to taking the Advanced Web Design course next semester!</p>
